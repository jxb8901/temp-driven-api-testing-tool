# Jobs, events and recovery APIs

## Server-sent events

Connect to `/api/v1/jobs/{jobId}/events` with `Accept: text/event-stream`. Events are retained in `dataDir/jobs/<jobId>/events.jsonl`, assigned increasing numeric IDs per job, and named `status`, `progress`, `log`, `diagnostic`, or `result`.

```text
id: 2
event: status
data: {"jobId":"J...","status":"RUNNING"}

```

Send `Last-Event-ID` after reconnecting to replay retained events with greater IDs. If older events have expired from the bounded journal, the stream resumes with events still retained. The stream sends `: keepalive` comments while idle and closes after it delivers the terminal result. A disconnected observer does not cancel the job. Up to 32 observers receive dedicated stream threads through direct handoff; excess observers are rejected with HTTP 503 before a stream starts. Each observer has its own one-entry notification queue. Client writes happen outside the Worker event reader.

## Cancellation and recovery

`DELETE /jobs/{jobId}` requests graceful Worker termination, waits up to `gracefulStopMs`, and then force-terminates only that Worker if needed. The job record remains available. A Server restart does not automatically rerun jobs that were not terminal.

Public Artifact paths are logical paths inside the verified Job ZIP. Loose Worker output is private and has no direct download route. Absolute paths, traversal, and symlink escapes are rejected. The Server does not expose general filesystem browsing or package mutation APIs.
