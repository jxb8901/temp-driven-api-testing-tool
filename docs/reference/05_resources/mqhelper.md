### 5.3 MQHelper

MQHelper is a first-class IBM MQ resource. Each descriptor uses `schemaVersion: att-mqhelper/v1.0`, a stable logical `id`, connection topology and optional credentials. Global `mqhelpers` references descriptor files; environment profiles may select a different descriptor for the same logical ID.

Primary calls are:

```text
#{mq.<id>.send(...)}
#{mq.<id>.receive(...)}
#{mq.<id>.request(...)}
```

Payloads are file-based so request bytes do not have to be duplicated into Context/evidence. `request` combines send and correlated receive behavior. Correlation identifiers, queue/operation metadata, timing and diagnostic information are evidence; credentials and payload bytes are not copied into evidence.

Timeout behavior is operation-specific and remains distinct from assertion failure. MQ connection/pool lifecycle is framework-owned resource state, especially in Load mode; it is not exposed as a public `EXEC.MQ` tree.

ATT's default build does not require IBM MQ client classes. Runtime MQ use requires the IBM MQ client jar/profile documented by the package/release instructions. MQ operations feed the same Action result/evidence envelope as Tool and DB operations.
