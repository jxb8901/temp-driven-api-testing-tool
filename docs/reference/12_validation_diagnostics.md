## 12 Validation and Diagnostics

<!-- Transitional placement produced by issue #41. #42 owns semantic reorganization. -->

### 09 Troubleshooting

#### Start with validation

Run this after every workbook, sidecar, template, or tool change:

```sh
./att.sh validate --package
```

Then use the diagnostic code and structured location. Do not automate against message text.

| Category | Typical cause | Corrective action |
|---|---|---|
| `ATT-TC` | Missing/stale snapshot, sidecar/sheet/header error, or duplicate Case ID | Check snapshot/basenames, sheet mapping, effective headers, and full IDs |
| `ATT-CTX` | Unknown or ambiguous Context path | Inspect requested/current/missing fields, nearest suggestion, or canonical candidates |
| `ATT-STG` | Blank required selector, invalid selector YAML, duplicate stage key | Check selector form, `name`, aliases, and required flag |
| `ATT-TPL` | Unknown/duplicate template, invalid action or payload | Check symbolic name/full path, descriptor, action type, and local files |
| `ATT-CFG` | Unknown field, duplicate key, wrong schema/type/enum | Compare with Chapter 6 and remove unsupported fields |
| `ATT-TOOL` | Unknown/missing argument, process or parse failure | Compare call contract, inspect exit code/stdout/stderr/raw output |
| `ATT-PATH` | Illegal ID or escaping path | Remove illegal characters and keep content below configured roots |
| `ATT-RUN` | Timeout, non-zero exit, render/runtime failure | Inspect case log and action/tool evidence |

#### Common questions

##### Why is the Case ID rejected although Excel displays it correctly?

ATT imports displayed cell text, then applies strict ID safety checks. Check hidden leading/trailing whitespace, trailing `.`, path characters, controls, and Windows device names. Store identifiers as text to preserve leading zeroes.

##### Can two sheets both contain `TC001`?

Yes. Give sheets different group IDs, producing IDs such as `payment.payment.TC001` and `payment.batch.TC001`.

##### Why did `N/A` become empty?

ATT normalizes `N/A`, `NA`, `NULL`, `NONE`, empty, and whitespace-only values to blank before data mapping and stage selection.

##### Why does a Context variable fail?

ATT treats an absent path as an authoring/runtime error instead of silently rendering it as empty. Follow `ATT-CTX-001` and its `requestedPath`, `currentNode`, `missingSegment`, and nearest suggestion to check the case-sensitive scope, physical header/alias, stage key, action ID, and availability point. A suffix shorthand must identify exactly one readable logical path; `ATT-CTX-002` lists every conflicting candidate so you can lengthen it. The diagnostic intentionally omits the full Context tree. A declared optional field with a blank value is still valid and renders as the empty string.

##### Why did a FAIL become ERROR?

A false assertion is FAIL. Invalid expression syntax/navigation, tool failure, timeout, parse failure, I/O failure, or runtime exception is ERROR. Inspect the action evidence rather than only the final aggregate status.

##### Why did a tool run more than once?

Its action used retry and received an eligible non-zero exit code. Inspect the attempt list and final action record in the case log.

##### Can I use a shell pipeline in `command`?

No. ATT passes `|`, `>`, and `<` literally. Put shell behavior inside a reviewed tool script.

##### Why does a required array argument reject `[]`?

Required validation happens before argv expansion. An empty typed List is missing input; pass at least one scalar item or make the argument optional.

##### Should I use package or selected validation?

Use selected mode for fast local feedback. Use package mode before release, CI promotion, or sharing a package.

##### Can reports be opened without a server?

Yes. Keep the generated run directory together so relative artifact links continue to work.

##### Does build execute tests again?

No. It archives one completed persisted run.

##### Why does `att.bat` ask for Maven, or why does a `.sh` tool fail on Windows?

In a binary release, `att.bat` finds `lib\att-*.jar` and only requires Java 8+. In a source tree it compiles with Maven when Maven is on `PATH`; without Maven, previously compiled `target\classes` must exist. Use `att.bat version` to confirm the launcher before validating the package.

The launcher makes ATT itself cross-platform; it cannot translate external tool executables. Configure a Windows-compatible `.bat`, `.cmd`, PowerShell script (with an explicit `powershell`/`pwsh` argv), or native executable instead of a POSIX-only `.sh` command. PATH validation follows Windows `PATHEXT`, so names such as `pwsh` can resolve `pwsh.exe`. Keep argument contracts and stdout output formats identical when maintaining platform variants.

##### Why did ATT say it will use mwiede/jsch, or why did Java SSH algorithm negotiation fail?

ATT uses the local `ssh` command when it is executable on `PATH`. If it is absent, ATT prints `local ssh command not found; ATT will use Java SSH library mwiede/jsch` and opens a Java exec channel instead. This is an automatic fallback, not a remote connectivity test.

The fallback is deliberately minimal: ATT includes `com.github.mwiede:jsch:2.28.2` but does not bundle Bouncy Castle. It requires a readable non-symbolic-link `~/.ssh/known_hosts` for strict host verification. It does not read `~/.ssh/config` or automatically use the OpenSSH agent; configure an unencrypted or otherwise non-interactively readable `identityFile`. Password and interactive passphrase prompts remain unsupported.

Algorithm availability depends on the Java runtime:

| Algorithm | Java fallback limitation | Preferred solution |
|---|---|---|
| `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-ed448` | Require Java 15+, or a Bouncy Castle provider | Prefer local OpenSSH or Java 15+; otherwise have an administrator add approved `bcprov-jdk18on` to the runtime classpath |
| `curve25519-sha256`, `curve448-sha512` | Require Java 11+, or Bouncy Castle | Prefer local OpenSSH or Java 11+; otherwise use an approved Bouncy Castle provider |
| `chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com` | Requires Bouncy Castle on every Java version | Prefer local OpenSSH, enable an AES-GCM/CTR cipher on the server, or add an approved Bouncy Castle provider |
| RSA/SHA-1 `ssh-rsa` signatures | Disabled by default by mwiede/jsch | Update the server to RSA/SHA-2 (`rsa-sha2-256`/`rsa-sha2-512`) or another modern host/user-key algorithm; do not re-enable SHA-1 except as a reviewed temporary legacy measure |

When negotiation fails, first run the same connection with local `ssh -v` to identify the host-key, key-exchange, cipher, or user-key mismatch. Prefer upgrading Java or the server's algorithm set over weakening JSch defaults. The authoritative compatibility notes and configurable `jsch.kex`, `jsch.server_host_key`, `jsch.cipher`, and `jsch.mac` system properties are documented in the [mwiede/jsch README](https://github.com/mwiede/jsch). ATT does not change those secure defaults.

#### Security reminders

Do not place passwords, tokens, private keys, or sensitive customer data in workbook cells, template descriptors, command strings, stdout, or stderr. Prefer approved secret injection inside tool scripts. Review reports and archives before sharing.
