## 08 Reliability and Execution Control

This chapter owns cross-cutting public execution behavior.

### Assertion and status

An assertion evaluates a boolean condition after the Action's primary work at the documented assertion point. A false assertion is `FAIL`; an exception/infrastructure problem is `ERROR`; invalid authoring/configuration is `INVALID`; a non-selected condition is `SKIPPED`; successful work is `PASS`. Operation failure and assertion failure are therefore distinct.

### `runWhen` and `onFailure`

`runWhen` controls whether a statically known Action/Stage is eligible to execute. `onFailure: stop|continue` controls continuation after failure; `continue` never changes the failed status into PASS. Cleanup/diagnostic work should use the documented conditional execution semantics rather than hiding failures.

### Timeout

Timeout terminates or abandons the operation according to the supported backend and records diagnostic/evidence. Timeout is an operational failure; it is not an assertion false result. Tool timeout behavior and resource-specific DB/MQ limits are documented in their resource contracts.

### Retry and attempts

Where retry is supported, one logical Action owns multiple attempts. Retry policy determines which operation failures are retryable. The final/winning operation becomes top-level `output.result` / `output.evidence`; every attempt remains available under `output.attempts[n]`. A later success does not erase earlier attempt evidence.

### Evidence collectors

Tool evidence collectors run after the primary operation and before that attempt's assertion. Collectors have independent timeout and `onFailure: continue|stop`. Collector output belongs to the attempt's evidence and never replaces the primary operation result.

### Transaction/resource lifecycle

DB transaction finalization and DB/MQ resource cleanup occur at the appropriate execution lifecycle boundary. These mechanisms can affect operation success/diagnostics but are internal resource state, not public Context namespaces.

### Aggregation

When multiple child outcomes contribute to a parent, severity is preserved:

```text
ERROR > INVALID > FAIL > PASS > SKIPPED
```

Future fixture behavior (#38) and DB Action-level timeout/retry (#39) extend this chapter's existing concepts rather than creating a new reliability model.
